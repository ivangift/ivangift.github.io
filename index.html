    Ivan's Workshop <br/>
    There is nothing here, you may want to use:<br/>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/nikkiup2u3">Nikki's wardrobe, the online clothes recommendation system.</a></li>

        Well, there have to be something, otherwise my adsense account won't get approved. That's so ridiculous, not to mention
        as a SWE working for google ads, I don't even know how to get my account approved internally. So basically I received
        an auto-replied mail said sorry it seems that your site is still in construction blah blah blah. Come on this is just a
        portal, all my contents and daily PVs go to the sub pages, Nikki's wardrobe. What am I expected to put here? A welcome
        message to google bot saying that I'm fine, my site is fine and it's not in constrution so please approve my application?!
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway I'm still strugling to fill in "meaningful words" so that our classifier will not think of my site as "not enough
        content". But seriously I should really try to find internal ways to get my account approved, instead of typing complains
        here. Or maybe I should just copy/paste some random texts, news, novels or even my codes here. But I still want to keep
        my pages clean and meaningful, at least meaningful to real users.

        Another thing raised my concern is, in less than one hour after my first application, auto approver rejected it. But it
        has been more than 6 hours since my second application and there is nothing happened yet. What if they are using
        exponential backoff algorithm to crawl pages? Can I get it approved before the end of nikki's life? I really wondered...

        Update: <br/>
        I'm so disappointed that my colleague working on OPG told me that my site has to be "full of meaningful original content".
        Come on the how could bot tell if it's original, or meaningful. We both know that bot doesn't work in that way. Please
        talk with me as a coworker not diplomat okay? Don't treat me as a theif trying to steal company properties or pretend
        adsense has such a high bar of quanlity control.

        But now I realized that there could be ways to solve the problem, one is to use DFP, another google ads product which
        technically cannot "steal" any money from google. That's much easier because I don't even have to create a personal DFP
        account. What I have to do is just creating a new, sponsorship lineitem, put the code snippet into the html and...
      </p>
      <p>
        Another way is to keep on posting more data, maybe novel, maybe tech report (anyway, who cares) here until it successfully
        fools the bot (which I believe should be easy enough). I don't really have to post junk here since I already have lots of
        meaningful information (which may not be agreed by my OPG colleage, who knows) below. We'll see.
