    Ivan's Workshop <br/>
    There is nothing here, you may want to use:<br/>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/nikkiup2u3">Nikki's wardrobe, the online clothes recommendation system.</a></li>
    </ul>

      Well, there have to be something, otherwise my adsense account won't get approved. That's so ridiculous, not to mention
      as a SWE working for google ads, I don't even know how to get my account approved internally. So basically I received
      an auto-replied mail said sorry it seems that your site is still in construction blah blah blah. Come on this is just a
      portal, all my content and daily PVs goes to the sub pages, Nikki's wardrobe. What am I expected to put here? A welcome
      message to google bot saying that I'm fine, my site is fine and it's not in constrution so please approve my application?!
