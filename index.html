    Ivan's Workshop <br/>
    There is nothing here, you may want to use:<br/>

      <li><a href="/nikkiup2u3">Nikki's wardrobe, the online clothes recommendation system.</a></li>
    </ul>

      Well, there have to be something, otherwise my adsense account won't get approved. That's so ridiculous, not to mention
      as a SWE working for google ads, I don't even know how to get my account approved internally. So basically I received
      an auto-replied mail said sorry it seems that your site is still in construction blah blah blah. Come on this is just a
      portal, all my contents and daily PVs go to the sub pages, Nikki's wardrobe. What am I expected to put here? A welcome
      message to google bot saying that I'm fine, my site is fine and it's not in constrution so please approve my application?!
    </p>

      Anyway I'm still strugling to fill in "meaningful words" so that our classifier will not think of my site as "not enough
      content". But seriously I should really try to find internal ways to get my account approved, instead of typing complains
      here. Or maybe I should just copy/paste some random texts, news, novels or even my codes here. But I still want to keep
      my pages clean and meaningful, at least meaningful to real users.

      Another thing raised my concern is, in less than one hour after my first application, auto approver rejected it. But it
      has been more than 6 hours since my second application and there is nothing happened yet. What if they are using
      exponential backoff algorithm to crawl pages? Can I get it approved before the end of nikki's life? I really wondered...
